# Planner-Project-CS2
Making a planner program for final project in CS2

# Project Name: Planner

# Project Description
The goal of our project is to create a planner which is utilized to help the user organize their life.
The program will include a calendar, contact sheet, to-do list, and a tool which can help the user determine
when they have free time. This free time tool will analyze when the user does not have anything planned, and
it can suggest what to do. We will try to make this happen by using the programming skills learned through the year as well and skills learned previously and skills we learn while researching how to efficently complete our project.
